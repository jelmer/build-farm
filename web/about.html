<h2>About the build farm</h2>

The samba.org build farm is designed to test the configuration and
build of some projects hosted on samba.org in real time. Each host in
the build farm builds each of the projects regularly (currently every
15 minutes for some hosts) and uploads the results of the configure and
build to the central site (build.samba.org) for display.

<p>This allows team members to check on the build status on a wide
variety of operating systems and architectures without the drudgery of
logging into each machine after each CVS commit.

<p>The build farm pulls the source code from the <a
href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/unpacked/">unpacked CVS repository</a>
and does a clean configure and build whenever a change is detected in
the tree. The results shown give information on the status of the
configure and build process, plus any error logs.

<p>In future we plan on expanding the build farm to do basic runtime testing as well.

<p>The author of the build farm is <a
href="mailto:tridge@samba.org">Andrew Tridgell</a>. The source for the
build farm is available in the build_farm cvs tree on the 
<a href="http://pserver.samba.org/">samba.org CVS server</a>.

<p>The build farm is now maintained by <a href="mailto:vance@samba.org">Vance
Lankhaar</a>. He replaces long-time maintainer <a href="mailto:abartlet@samba.org">Andrew
Bartlett</a>, allowing Andrew to focus more time on Samba development. </p>

<p>If you have a machine that you wish to participate in our build farm
then please read these <a href="instructions.html">instructions</a>.
