This is the build system for build.samba.org

tridge@samba.org, April 2001

To set it up on a new box you need to do this:

1) create an account on the box (I'll assume its called "build")
2) copy over build_test to ~build/build_farm/
3) put the right password in ~build/build_farm/.password
4) store host specific configuration (like PATH, hostname, ...)
   in ~build/build_farm/build_test.settings.local
5) arrange for ~build/build_farm/build_test to be run regularly
   from cron
6) add the host to svn://svn.samba.org/home/svn/build-farm/trunk/web/hosts.list
7) if desired, create a HOSTNAME.fns file that defines what gets built on
   build.samba.org
